    <br> In the Year of Supreme Heroism, <br>
    The mighty Buri Buri Zaemon fearlessly charged into an evil villain’s luxurious villa… <br>

    <br> With one majestic leap and absolutely zero planning, <br>
    he unleashed catastrophic destruction. <br>

    <br> Walls collapsed. <br>
    Chandeliers surrendered. <br>
    Furniture accepted its fate. <br>

    But the curtains did not. <br>

    「正義の味方は忙しいのだ！」<br>
    “A hero of justice is a busy man!” <br>
    ---- by Buri-Buri zaemon




    <h4> "The Catastrophe Containment of Lake Sorrow"</h4> <br>
    <br>When reports emerged of a monstrous aquatic menace terrorizing the shores of Lake Sorrow, <br>
    Buri Buri Zaemon responded without hesitation — or prior confirmation. <br>

    <br> Arriving on the scene in full ceremonial armor,<br>
    he announced the commencement of “Operation Aquatic Justice” to no one in particular. <br>




    <br> One rowboat overturned (strategically). <br>

    <br> A wave dramatically displaced. <br>

    <br> The “sea monster” identified as an unusually shaped log. <br>

    <br> Undeterred by factual clarification, <br>
    Buri Buri Zaemon proclaimed the lake officially liberated. <br>

    <br> The waters were calm shortly afterward. <br>

    <br> Historians continue to debate whether the calm was natural <br>
    or a direct consequence of his overwhelming heroic presence.
