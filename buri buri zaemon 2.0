        <h4>“The Great Villa Annihilation Incident”</h4>
    </dt>

    <dd> In the Year of Supreme Heroism, <br>
        The mighty Buri Buri Zaemon fearlessly charged into an evil villain’s luxurious villa… <br>

        <br> With one majestic leap and absolutely zero planning, <br>
        he unleashed catastrophic destruction. <br>

        <br> Walls collapsed. <br>
        Chandeliers surrendered. <br>
        Furniture accepted its fate. <br>

        <br> The villa was reduced to heroic rubble. <br>

        <br> The villain escaped. <br>
        But the curtains did not. <br>

    「正義の味方は忙しいのだ！」<br>
    “A hero of justice is a busy man!” <br>
    ---- by Buri-Buri zaemon

        <h4> "The Catastrophe Containment of Lake Sorrow"</h4>
    </dt>


    <dd> When reports emerged of a monstrous aquatic menace terrorizing the shores of Lake Sorrow, <br>
        Buri Buri Zaemon responded without hesitation — or prior confirmation. <br>

        <br> Arriving on the scene in full ceremonial armor,<br>
        he announced the commencement of “Operation Aquatic Justice” to no one in particular. <br>

        <br> One rowboat overturned (strategically). <br>

        <br> A wave dramatically displaced. <br>

        <br> The “sea monster” identified as an unusually shaped log. <br>

        <br> Undeterred by factual clarification, <br>
        Buri Buri Zaemon proclaimed the lake officially liberated. <br>

        <br> The waters were calm shortly afterward. <br>

        <br> Historians continue to debate whether the calm was natural <br>
        or a direct consequence of his overwhelming heroic presence.
